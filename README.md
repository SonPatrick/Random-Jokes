# Random Jokes Application

It's a very simple command line application that prints Chuck Norris Joke every 2 seconds within 10 seconds time frame. 

The purpose of this app was to test RxJava2 capabilities combined with Retrofit 2 to fetch data from the REST API service periodically. 

Based on this project I've write a blog post: **COMMING SOON**
